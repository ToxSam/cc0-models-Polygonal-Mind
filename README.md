# Open Source 3D Assets — GLB Collection

**CC0-licensed 3D environments and props, converted to GLB for universal use.**

This repo makes the [Polygonal Mind Open Source Initiative](https://github.com/PolygonalMind/initiative-opensource-release) more accessible by converting everything to **GLB format** — ready to drop into any engine, web project, or 3D tool without dealing with FBX imports or Unity packages.

**Focus:** 3D environments and props only. For avatars, check out **[open-source-avatars](https://github.com/ToxSam/open-source-avatars)** — VRM-formatted characters ready for VRChat, Vtubing, and games.

## What's here

CC0 asset packs from metaverse projects spanning 2018–2023: medieval fairs, retro booths, Egyptian pyramids, neon pagodas, vaporwave rooms, museum pieces, gardens, and more. Originally released as FBX, Unity packages, and platform-specific formats — now all GLB, no gatekeeping.

### Conversion status

| ✅ Converted (18 packs) | 🔄 In progress | ⬜ To-do |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------|
| XYZ, ABM, Avatar Garden, CA World, Chromatic Chaos VHS, Cryptoavatars Retro Booth, Crystal Crossroads, LowPolyStore (3 variants), Medieval Fair, Momus Park, South DCL (3 variants), The Avatar Show, Tomb Chaser 1 & 2 | Avatar Webcam | Babylon, Dethrone, Underworld |

**Stats so far:**
- ~991 GLB files ready to use
- ~2.1 GB total (just the models, no bloat)

---

## The process

1. **Downloaded** all packs from the original initiative
2. **Batch converted** FBX → GLB using Blender scripts
3. **Manual cleanup** on each model:
   - Materials consolidated
   - Textures optimized
   - Unused slots removed
   - Naming cleaned up
   - Colliders preserved where needed

Not just raw exports — curated, tested, ready to use.

## About the original work

Between 2018–2023, my team and I at [Polygonal Mind](https://github.com/PolygonalMind) (Zaragoza-based, est. 2015) built environments, games, and virtual spaces for Decentraland, VRChat, The Sandbox, Hyperfy, and more. We made the **100 Avatars** daily series, **Tomb Chaser** platformers, **Virtual Market** booths, museum installations, and a bunch of weird experimental stuff.

The company closed in 2024, but the work shouldn't disappear. We released many of it under CC0 — this repo is just making sure it stays accessible and easy to use.
